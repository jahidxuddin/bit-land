# Bit Land

Welcome to **Bit-Land**, a simple console-based game where you navigate a player character in a grid world, collecting entities to increase your score. This project is my first C++ program, and it's been a great learning experience!

## Game Description

In Bit-Land, you control a player character represented by the symbol `1`. The goal is to collect a certain amount of entities, represented by the symbol `0`, scattered randomly throughout the grid. Each time you collect an entity, your score increases by one.

### How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game by running the executable.
2. **Control the Player**:
    - Use the `W` or `UP` arrow key to move up.
    - Use the `S` or `DOWN` arrow key to move down.
    - Use the `A` or `LEFT` arrow key to move left.
    - Use the `D` or `RIGHT` arrow key to move right.
3. **Collect Entities**: Move over the entities (`0`) to collect them and increase your score.
4. **Exit the Game**: Press the `ESC` key to exit the game at any time.

### Game Features

- **Random Entity Placement**: Entities are placed randomly on the grid, ensuring a unique experience each time you play.
- **Real-Time Movement**: Smooth player movement using keyboard input.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your score, showing the current score and the maximum possible score based on the grid size.
